# Simple Linked List Implementation in C++

## Project Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of a basic linked list data structure. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as dynamic memory management, pointers, and class design in C++. The linked list allows for various operations that are essential for understanding how linear data structures work in a low-level programming language like C++.

## Features
- **Node Structure**: Fundamental building block of the linked list, containing data and a pointer to the next node.
- **LinkedList Class**: The main class that manages the nodes and provides functionalities to manipulate the list.
- **Core Operations**:
  - `append`: Add a new node to the end of the list.
  - `prepend`: Insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
  - `deleteWithValue`: Remove the first node with the specified value.
  - `find`: Find and return a node with a given value.
  - `reverse`: Reverse the order of nodes in the list.
  - `getSize`: Get the current size of the list.
  - `printList`: Display all the nodes in the list.

## How It Works
The `LinkedList` class manages a series of connected `Node` objects, each pointing to the next node in the list. This setup allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations at both the beginning and the end of the list. The class provides various methods to manipulate the list, including adding and removing nodes, searching for values, reversing the list order, and more.

## Usage
This implementation can be used as an educational tool for understanding how linked lists function and are implemented in C++. It's also a starting point for more complex data structures and algorithms.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing a `tail` pointer for more efficient append operations.
- Adding more functionalities such as sorting, merging, and splitting the list.
- Extending the implementation to a doubly linked list for bidirectional traversal.
